# Chess <br />
Main goal of this project is to learn how to manage complex project, learning how to design complex systems along the way. <br />
This project is not yet complete. <br />
This project does not have a build system yet. <br />
I do not own anything in Resources Folder. They are for testing temporarily.

What I have implemented so far: <br />
ECS system. <br />
Scripting with c++. <br />
Scenes. <br />
Seperate project to play audio, simple multi threaded audio engine with PortAudio. <br />

Future plans: <br />
Crossplatform build system. <br />
Renderer2D. <br />
More threads. <br />

Dependencies: <br />
(my AudioEngine library) [which uses PortAudio] <br />
Opengl <br />
glfw <br />
freetype <br />
stb image <br />
